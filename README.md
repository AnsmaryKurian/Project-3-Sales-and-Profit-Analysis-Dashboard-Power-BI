# Sales-and-Profit-Analysis-Dashboard--project-3-
This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive analysis of sales and profit data across various segments, countries, and products. The dashboard is structured into three main sheets: Sales Overview, Product Analysis, and Time-Based Analysis.
  Each sheet contains at least seven visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and more, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance. Interactive elements such as buttons, slicers, and bookmarks are incorporated to allow users to easily navigate between different views, filter data by various criteria, and switch between summary and detailed perspectives. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, enabling decision-makers to quickly gain insights and make informed decisions.

In the Sales Overview sheet, users can explore sales and profit data by segment and country, while the Product Analysis sheet dives deeper into product performance, including sales by product, profit margins, and detailed trend analysis. The Time-Based Analysis sheet offers a temporal view of the data, allowing users to track sales trends over time and compare yearly performance. The dashboard is fully customizable and scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of business contexts. This project serves as a powerful tool for analyzing financial data and supporting strategic planning and operational decisions.
